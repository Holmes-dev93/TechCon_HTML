            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>TechCon was founded in 2018 by a small group of visionary developers aiming to bridge the gap between academic research and industry application. What started as a local meetup has evolved into one of the world's most influential technology conferences. Our first event, held in a small auditorium, featured just 12 speakers. Today, we host thousands of attendees and hundreds of sessions across multiple tracks.</p>
